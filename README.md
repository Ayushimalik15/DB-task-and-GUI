We require functions that include adding, viewing, deleting, and updating contact lists. While adding the contact of a person, he/she has to provide the first name, last name, gender, address, and contact details. The user can also update the contact list if he/she wants to. For this, the user has to double-click on a record that he/she wishes to edit. The system shows the contact details in a list view. And also the user easily deletes any contact details.
